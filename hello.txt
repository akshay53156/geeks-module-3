We are learning Git and its basic commands.

1. Git init -- to initialize the local repository.

2. Git status -- to check status of repository.

3. Git add <file name> -- This is step where we add our file/files to staging area.

4. Git commit -- using this command we commit all the files which added in staging area to be commit.
