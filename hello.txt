We are learning Git and its basic commands.

1. Git init -- to initialize the local repository.

2. Git status -- to check status of repository.

3. Git add <file name> -- This is step where we add our file/files to staging area.

4. Git commit -m "commit message" -- using this command we commit all the files which added in staging area to be commit.

5. git branch -M main -- to change the name of local repo branch

6. git remote add origin <remote repo url> -- connecting local repo with remote repo

7. git remote -v -- to verify connection is successful 

8. git push -u origin main -- to first time push code to remote repo main branch after this only git push work

This all steps done for first time code push. for updation in code after push follow below steps:
